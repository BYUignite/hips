Curved channel flow case. The ODT line spans the radius. The flow is driven
by an off-line pressure gradient interpreted as azimuthal (1/r dP/dTheta).

TO DO:
- check non-dimensionalization
- check correspondence to Dean flow
- reference DNS by Moser (1985) NASA TM-85974
- Q: Is the ODT case any different from axial annulus flow?
  A: Probably the prescribed momentum source is dP/dx = dP/dTheta = const.
     Hence we need to implement the radius correction 1/r unless solving
     for angular momentum. Check that in the implementation.
