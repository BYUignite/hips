i# HiPS (Hierarchical Parcel Swapping)

This code implements the Hierarchal Parcel Swapping (HiPS) model for turbulent reacting or nonreacting flows.

## Directory structure
* `build_make`: build the code using standard GNU make.
* `cmake_build`: build the code using cmake.
* `data`: contains all data files output during a simulation.
    * The code will generate a subfolder with a name corresponding to case name specified in the run script in the run folder.
        * This case subfolder will contain subfolders `input`, `runtime`, `data`, and `post`, which contain the input data files, runtime output, simulation data files, and post-processed data, respectively.
* `doc`: contains documentation files built using Doxygen.
* `input`: contains case input files, notably `input.yaml`, which is the primary input file with code parameters.
    * Other input files are a Cantera mechanism file in `gas_mechanisms` and an optional `restart.yaml` file.
* `post`: contains post-processing scripts and files for given cases. 
   * Output is placed in `data/caseName/post`. These are mostly Python files. Some cases also include experimental data files for comparison and plotting.
* `run`: contains the code executable `hips-run` and several run scripts. These scripts are run by the user to execute the code.
    * The user specifies inputDir as the path to the input file containing the case to run and specifies a case name for variable caseName. Files are created and copied into `data/caseName`, as noted above.
    * The user chooses one of the following run scripts to execute the code: 
      * `runOneRlz.sh` will run a single realization of the code. This is appropriate for some cases, like a statistically stationary channel flow. Many cases require running many realizations to gather turbulent statistics.
      * `runManRlz.sh` will run many realizations on a single processor.
      * `slrmJob.sh` is an example script for running embarrasingly parallel simulations, i.e. one realization for each MPI process.
      * `slrmJob_array.sh` is an example script that runs multiple realizations on a parallel machine using a slurm array.
    * `changeInputParam.py` is a convenience script for changing a value of a variable in the input file. This is convenient when running several cases changing an input parameter and can be used within the run scripts listed above.
* `source`: contains source code (including header files) and `CMakeLists.txt` files.

## Dependencies
### HiPS code
* [Cantera](http://cantera.org): open-source suite of tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport.
* Yaml: input file format. This installation is conveniently built into the HiPS build process. 
* Cmake 3.12 or higher
* (OPTIONAL) Doxygen: builds documentation. 
### Post-processing
Post-processing data produced by HiPS is processed via Python 3 scripts. We recommend Python 3.2 or higher. Scripts may not function properly using Python 2.x. The following packages are required and can be installed via pip3:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* glob
* yaml
* sys
* os

## Build
Two build systems are available: a standard GNU make, and cmake. We recommend the cmake version whenever possible. See the README files in the `build_make` and `cmake_build` folders for details.

## Test cases
### HiPS Test
  1. Build the code using either Cmake or GNU make. We recommend Cmake whenever possible.
  2. Navigate to the `run` directory. Open `runOneRlz.sh` and confirm that the input file path and case name are set properly. The defaults in `runOneRlz.sh` are `inputDir="../input/hips"` and `caseName="hips_test"`.
  3. Run `./runOneRlz.sh` to run the case. It should take less than two minutes on an average system. 
  4. Navigate to `post/channelFlow`. 
  5. Run `python3 stats.py [caseName]`. With the default case name, this becomes `python3 stats.py channel`. This will generate two plots in `../data/[caseName]/post`. Navigate there to view them. 
  6. In `../data/[caseName]/post`, there should be two newly-generated PDFs. These two plots compare the mean and RMS velocity profiles of the channel flow case just run with HiPS to previous DNS data of the same case.
