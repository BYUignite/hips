\mbox{[}Hi\+PS\mbox{]} is an open-\/source C++ library that serves as both a standalone mixing model and a sub-\/grid model for Transported Probability Distribution Functions.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Dependencies and installation}{Dependencies and installation}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The code is intended to be built and used on Linux-\/like systems, including Mac\+OS and the Linux subsystem for Windows.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Required software\+:}{Required software\+:}}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create and navigate into a top-\/level {\ttfamily build} directory
\item Configure CMake\+: {\ttfamily cmake ..}
\item Build Hi\+PSlib\+: {\ttfamily make}
\item Install Hi\+PSlib\+: {\ttfamily make install}
\item Make documentation\+: {\ttfamily make docs}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{CMake configuration variables}{CMake configuration variables}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
The default CMake configuration should be adequate for users that do not immediately require the examples, tests, or documentation. CMake configuration options can be set by editing the top-\/level {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} file, editing the {\ttfamily CMake\+Cache.\+txt} file (generated in the {\ttfamily build} directory after running CMake at least once), or specifying them on the command line during step 2 as follows\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ -\/DHIPSLIB\_BUILD\_EXAMPLES=ON\ ..}

\end{DoxyCode}


The following project-\/specific CMake configuration variables can be specified by the user; their default values are also indicated. \tabulinesep=1mm

The {\ttfamily REACTIONS\+\_\+\+ENABLED} flag determines whether the Hi\+PS library supports chemical reactions. When set to {\ttfamily ON}, the library includes functionality for reactions, requiring additional libraries like Contra or Sundials. When set to {\ttfamily OFF}, only simple mixing is supported, and these additional libraries are not needed. Users can adjust this flag based on whether they require reaction support and have the necessary libraries installed.

 \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Using Hi\+PS}{Using Hi\+PS}}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
The Hi\+PS library consists of three main object classes that users can interact with\+: {\ttfamily hips}, {\ttfamily \doxylink{classbatch_reactor__cvode}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cvode}}, and {\ttfamily \doxylink{classbatch_reactor__cantera}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cantera}}. These classes serve as the computational engine responsible for advancing the reaction system through time, solving complex sets of differential equations.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example Workflow}{Example Workflow}}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
To integrate Hi\+PS into C++ code, include the {\ttfamily \doxylink{hips_8h}{hips.\+h}} header file. Users interact with Hi\+PS through four functions. The first function is {\ttfamily \doxylink{clasships}{hips(...)}} constructor which requires essential parameters such as the number of levels, length scale, time scale, variables count, a Cantera solution object (if reactions are involved), and a reaction flag to initialize an instance of the Hi\+PS class with the provided parameters. The second function, {\ttfamily set\+\_\+var\+Data(...)}, is used to pass vectors of parcels containing desired variable values to the tree (e.\+g. concentrations, enthalpy, etc.). The third function, {\ttfamily calculate\+Solution(...)}, executes calculations and simulations. Finally, to retrieve results, users employ {\ttfamily get\+\_\+var\+Data(...)}. For comprehensive implementation guidance and insights into Hi\+PS functionality, a workflow diagram is provided.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Implementation Guidelines}{Implementation Guidelines}}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
To implement a Hi\+PS simulation based on this example in an academic setting, adhere to the following guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compile the code, ensuring all necessary libraries and dependencies are correctly linked.
\item Execute the compiled binary to initiate the Hi\+PS simulation with the specified parameters.
\item Monitor the simulation progress and analyze the output for relevant information.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Researchers may customize parameters and mechanisms based on specific simulation requirements within the confines of this methodological framework.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Examples}{Examples}}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
Hi\+PS is written in C++ and includes three examples that illustrate its use\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{ex__1_8cc}{ex\+\_\+1.\+cc}\+:}} Demonstrates simple mixing using Hi\+PS, where fluid parcels are initialized with values of 0 and 1, and then mixed to reach an average value.
\item {\bfseries{\doxylink{ex__2_8cc}{ex\+\_\+2.\+cc}}} and {\bfseries{\doxylink{ex__3_8cc}{ex\+\_\+3.\+cc}\+:}} Illustrate Hi\+PS mixing coupled with chemical reactions, focusing on combustion processes. In these examples, turbulent flames are simulated with unique initialization procedures, showcasing control over ignition and extinction phenomena through parameters like mixing rate (\$\textbackslash{}tau\+\_\+0\$). Visual insights into the impact of mixing rate on ignition and extinction phenomena are provided.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Hi\+PS library supports two integrators for simulating chemical reactions within the framework. The first integrator, embedded in the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classbatch_reactor__cvode}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cvode}} class, uses the CVODE solver to seamlessly incorporate chemical kinetics. The second integrator within the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classbatch_reactor__cantera}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cantera}} class offers an alternative approach, utilizing Cantera\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in capabilities. Users can choose between these integrators based on their preferences and requirements, providing flexibility and robustness to efficiently simulate chemical reactions within the Hi\+PS library.
