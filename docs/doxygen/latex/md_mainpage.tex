\hypertarget{md_mainpage_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Using Hi\+PS}\label{md_mainpage_autotoc_md1}
The Hi\+PS library consists of three main object classes that users can interact with\+: {\ttfamily hips}, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classbatch_reactor__cvode}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cvode}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classbatch_reactor__cantera}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cantera}}}. {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classbatch_reactor__cvode}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cvode}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classbatch_reactor__cantera}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cantera}}} are two integrators which serve as the computational engine responsible for advancing the reaction system through time, solving complex sets of differential equations. ~\newline

To implement a Hi\+PS simulation based on this example in an academic setting, adhere to the following guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Compile the code, ensuring all necessary libraries and dependencies are correctly linked.
\item Execute the compiled binary to initiate the Hi\+PS simulation with the specified parameters.
\item Monitor the simulation progress and analyze the output for relevant information.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Researchers may customize parameters and mechanisms based on specific simulation requirements within the confines of this methodological framework.\hypertarget{md_mainpage_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{Examples}\label{md_mainpage_autotoc_md14}
Hi\+PS is written in C++ and includes three examples that illustrate its use. The first example {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{ex__1_8cc}{ex\+\_\+1.\+cc}}} shows how Hi\+PS is used for simple mixing. The first example, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{ex__1_8cc}{ex\+\_\+1.\+cc}}}, shows the basic simulation of scalar mixing to highlight the qualitative behavior of the simple mixing model. We set the first half of the fluid parcels an initial value of 0 and the second half of the fluid parcels a value of 1. They simply become mixed to the average value.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{ex__2_8cc}{ex\+\_\+2.\+cc}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{ex__3_8cc}{ex\+\_\+3.\+cc}}} are designed to facilitate the Hi\+PS mixing with a focus on chemical reactions, specifically targeting the combustion process. In the second case, a turbulent premixed flame was simulated using a stoichiometric ethylene/air mixture. The Chemical mechanism was \`{}`gri30'\textquotesingle{} which is advanced. A Hi\+PS domain with nine levels was initialized with 50\% of the parcels burnt and the other 50\% being fresh reactants. The mixing rate is varied through \$\textbackslash{}tau\+\_\+0\$. The Hi\+PS library supports two integrators for simulating chemical reactions within the framework. In the first integrator, embedded in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classbatch_reactor__cvode}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cvode}}} class, the CVODE solver seamlessly incorporates chemical kinetics. The class\textquotesingle{}s constructor establishes essential components, including the Cantera solution for thermodynamics and kinetics. The {\ttfamily react} function adeptly oversees the reaction simulation, considering parameters like enthalpy and species concentrations, while the underlying {\ttfamily rhsf} function computes reaction rates for a smooth integration process. Simultaneously, the second integrator within the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classbatch_reactor__cantera}{batch\+Reactor\+\_\+cantera}}} class offers an alternative approach, utilizing Cantera\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in capabilities. Users can set tolerances and maximum steps for a customized simulation experience. Whether opting for the CVODE solver or Cantera\textquotesingle{}s integrator, this choice provides a versatile and confident approach to efficiently simulate chemical reactions within the Hi\+PS library.
